 # Project Name
### This project is a part of the [Sprigboard's] (https://www.springboard.com/) 6 months long immersive program in data science. The project is about classifiying the credit default using the [lending club] (https://www.lendingclub.com/) data and to understand which factors contributes towards it the most. 
## Project status--About to be completed.
## Project Intro/Objective
### Lending Club is a money borrowing service that is in the business of providing loans for both personal and business purposes. The data they have collected contains 150 features and more than 2 million elements per feature. This is dense data and provides a unique opportunity of understanding if a lender is going to do default in the future or not? If one can come up with a simple model of classifying a future defaulter then it can greatly hedge the risk of the lender. This hedging of the risk with a simple and explanable model is the principal aim of this project. 
### The file here has the EDA and some data cleaning. Since the visualizations are mostly done on plotly and it is difficult to render them correctly on github-- so the link below will open it as an html page.
