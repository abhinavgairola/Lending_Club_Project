        "Often people tend to lend extra cash from the financial institutions of their choice to pay for home improvements, finance a wedding or consolidate high-interest debt etc. If used wisely (and there is a BIG If), a loan can fill the loan in the lenders budget without risking his/ her home or other assets. To seek a loan the lenders tend to go to a financial institution/ company which offers curated loans suitable for the lenders need. Lending Club is one such company which offers money borrowing service that is the company is in the business of providing loans for both personal and business purposes. They have a collection of the lender's data spanned over a certain period of time. The data which they have collected contains 150 features and more than 2 million elements per feature. This is dense data and provides a unique opportunity of understanding if a lender is going to do default in the future or not? If one can come up with a simple model of classifying a future defaulter then it can greatly hedge the risk of the lender. This hedging of the risk with a simple and explainable model is the principal aim of this project.\n",

        "The answer to this question lies in the Shap values--which essentially tells how much a change in feature will drive the output away from the average prediction. A typical example of the house price prediction is given here <a href=\"https://christophm.github.io/interpretable-ml-book/shap.html\"></a> which explains the idea quite well. For linear model the driver which will move the output away from average will be the weight times the feature value but for non-linear model this is not straightforward to answer. The Shap values are model agnostic and exactly explains the same. SHAP values has their origin in the game theory. The “game” here is the prediction task for a single instance of the dataset. The “players” are the feature values of the instance that collaborate to play the game (predict a value)--i.e. the loan is going to get charged off or not. In short Shapley values correspond to the contribution of each feature towards pushing the prediction away from the expected value of the model outcome. The above analysis was for shap values for each feature of every observation, it is possible to get a global interpretation using Shapley values by looking at it in a combined form.\n",

By performing the target encoding I was able to achieve decent result both with logistic regression and Xgboost models. Catboost is supposed to perform better however its abysmal recall value is not acceptable. In future I will try to improve the performance of catboost model by a more careful consideration. In the end the model results were explained using a metric derived from game theory i.e. the shap value.  \n",
